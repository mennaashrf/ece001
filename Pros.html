				<h1>Mundane tasks</h1>
					<h2> humans get bored, machines don't.
						Let them do the humdrum jobs. "A.I.
						allows for more intricate process automation,
						which increases productivity of resources and
						takes repetitive, boring labor off the shoulders
						of humans. They can focus on creative tasks instead,
						" said Felicia Schneiderhan, CEO of 30SecondToFly,
						an AI virtual travel assistant</h2>
				<h1>Faster actions and decisions</h1>
					<h2>A.I. and cognitive technologies 
						help in making faster actions and decisions.
						"Areas like automated fraud detection, 
						planning and scheduling further demonstrate 
						this benefit," said Kalyan Kumar, executive vice
						president at HCL Technologies, an IT services provider in India</h2>
					<ul><h1>Machine Learning</h1>
						<li><h2> Big Data means datasets in 
							the petabytes, far too much for a human 
							to sift through. AI can chew through that
							data as fast as the Xeon processors in 
							the servers can go and derive insights
							from the data much faster than any human
							could</h2></li>
						<li><h2>CloudPassage co-founder and CTO
							Carson Sweet argues this isn’t actual AI.
							"A lot of the big data processing and 
							analysis being attributed to AI is really 
							just the work of machine learning. True AI 
							would need to take things so much further; 
							toward genuine self-learning using artificial
							neural networks that emulate the structure
							and functions of neural networks in human 
							brains," he said</h2></li>
					</ul>
				<ul><h1>Error-Free Processing</h1>
					<li><h2> To err is human. Computers don't.
						The only mistakes they make is when you
						don't program them properly. AI processing
						will insure error-free processing of data,
						no matter how large the dataset. Judgement 
						calls, however, are a different matter</h2></li>
					<li><h2>Computers are 'stupid,' but that 
							is their brilliance - they demand such a 
							high level of rigor and AI adds quantitative
							rigor on top of that, that to use AI at all
							you first have to ask yourself the very
							challenging but stimulating question of what
							you're trying to do, with a new level of acuity,
							" said Dr. Nathan Wilson, CTO and co-founder of
							Nara Logics, synaptic intelligence company</h2>
