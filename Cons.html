			<h1>Job losses</h1>
				<h3>There is no way around it, AI will cost
					lesser-skilled people their jobs. Robots have
					already taken many jobs on assembly lines and
					as AI gets better at doing complex tasks, even
					more low-skill jobs will be taken.Driverless 
					cars is one obvious singular tech that will 
					displace millions of human drivers fairly 
					quickly, although the recent fatality 
					involving a Tesla car on auto-drive may
					have set the whole effort back a bit
				</h3><h1>A concentration of power</h1>
				<h3> AI could mean a lot of power will
					 be in the hands of a few who are controlling it
				</h3><h1>Bad callss</h1>
				<h3>AI does not have the ability to make
					a judgement call and may never get that ability
					. A really good example happened in Sydney, 
					Australia in 2014, when there was a shooting 
					and hostage drama downtown. People began ringing up
					Uber to get out of the affected area, and because
					of the surge in demand in a concentrated area,
					Uber's algorithms fell back on the trusted economics 
					of supply-and-demand and ride rates skyrocketed
				</h3></h3><h1>Autonomous weapons</h1>
				<h3>are artificial intelligence systems that are 
					programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person,
					these weapons could easily cause mass casualties
					. Moreover, an AI arms race could
					inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results
					in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted
					by the enemy, these weapons would be designed to
					be extremely difficult to simply “turn
					off,” so humans could plausibly lose control of
					such a situation. This risk is one that’s
					present even with narrow AI, but grows as levels 
					of AI intelligence and autonomy increase
